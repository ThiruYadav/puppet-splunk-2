This is a fork of some Puppet modules from our internal SVN repos. I hope that it will grow over time as I manage to sanitise and publish more of them.

Some of the modules are quite specific to our environment. We are a Gentoo and OpenBSD house almost in entirety, and I don't have the resource to test behaviour on other OSs. But I hope that the logic serves of use to other people and would welcome any commits.
